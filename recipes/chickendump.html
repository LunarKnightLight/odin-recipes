        <h2>Notes:</h2>
        <p>Be sure to use cooked chicken when making this recipe.  Leftover rotisserie chicken is a great option.  In a pinch, you can use prepackaged cooked chicken that you find in the meat section next to lunch meat.</p>
        <p>Cut the dough into small pieces. Smaller dumplings cook better than larger dumplings.  The dough will expand once it is placed in the warm broth.</p>
